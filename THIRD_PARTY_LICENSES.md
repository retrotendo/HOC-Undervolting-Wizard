# Third-Party Licenses and Credits

HOC Undervolting Wizard v0.4 incorporates and links against open-source software from other projects. The complete Wizard is distributed under **GNU GPL version 2 only (GPL-2.0-only)** because GPLv2 test code is incorporated into the executable. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for the complete GPLv2 text.

This file records the origin of incorporated test code, the changes made for this project, and the notices required by permissively licensed libraries.

## 1. CPU stress: Matrixprod + Hanoi verification

### Source used

The CPU test core in:

- `source/cpu_stress.c`
- `source/cpu_stress.h`

is based on the CPU stress implementation distributed in **Horizon-OC / Benchmark Toolbox**:

- `Source/Benchmark-Toolbox/source/cpustress/cpu_stress.c`
- `Source/Benchmark-Toolbox/source/cpustress/cpu_stress.h`
- https://github.com/Horizon-OC/Horizon-OC

Horizon-OC distributes its relevant code under **GNU GPL version 2**. Benchmark Toolbox bundles the Stress-NX workloads; Stress-NX / MembenchNX is credited in the Switch homebrew community to **Lineon**.

### Changes made by HOC Undervolting Wizard

The original Matrixprod and Hanoi algorithms are retained. The Wizard adds a mode that:

1. runs the Matrixprod workload;
2. runs the Hanoi verification pass after each Matrixprod pass;
3. counts a failed Hanoi verification as an automatic CPU mismatch.

This gives the Wizard the familiar Matrixprod CPU load while also providing automatic arithmetic-error detection.

The modified file carries a GPL-2.0-only SPDX identifier and a modification notice.

## 2. RAM test: memtester v4 algorithms

### Original project

**memtester** — a userspace memory subsystem tester.

Credits retained from the upstream project:

- Originally by **Simon Kirby**
- Version 2 by **Charles Cazabon**
- Version 4 rewrite Copyright (C) 2004-2020 **Charles Cazabon**
- Upstream mirror/source: https://github.com/jnavila/memtester

memtester version 4 is licensed under **GNU GPL version 2 only**.

### Switch adaptation used

The Switch-oriented test definitions and runner in:

- `source/mt_tests.c`
- `source/mt_tests.h`
- `source/mt_cpu.c`
- `source/mt_cpu.h`

are based on the memtester adaptation distributed as part of **Horizon-OC / Benchmark Toolbox**:

- `Source/Benchmark-Toolbox/source/memtester/mt_tests.c`
- `Source/Benchmark-Toolbox/source/memtester/mt_tests.h`
- `Source/Benchmark-Toolbox/source/memtester/mt_cpu.c`
- `Source/Benchmark-Toolbox/source/memtester/mt_cpu.h`
- https://github.com/Horizon-OC/Horizon-OC

The following memtester-style algorithms are present in the Wizard RAM test:

- Stuck Address
- Random Value
- Compare XOR
- Compare SUB
- Compare MUL
- Compare DIV
- Compare OR
- Compare AND
- Sequential Increment
- Solid Bits
- Block Sequential
- Checkerboard
- Bit Spread
- Bit Flip
- Walking Ones
- Walking Zeroes

The Switch runner dynamically maps available memory, runs the test sequence on worker threads, and exposes loop/mismatch/progress information to the Wizard UI.

### Changes made by HOC Undervolting Wizard

- moved the Switch port into this project;
- added explicit upstream, copyright and GPL notices;
- connected the runner to the Wizard timer/progress UI;
- an error or mismatch is propagated directly into the Wizard's automatic FAIL handling.

### License

**GNU General Public License version 2 only.** See `LICENSE`.

## 3. Horizon-OC / Benchmark Toolbox

Project: **Horizon-OC**

https://github.com/Horizon-OC/Horizon-OC

Horizon-OC's license file states, among other things, that `memtester` is GPLv2 and that its own relevant modifications are distributed under GPLv2. HOC Undervolting Wizard therefore distributes the derived CPU and RAM test code, and the complete combined work, under GPL-2.0-only.

No code from a standalone unlicensed Stress-NX repository is copied into HOC Undervolting Wizard. The CPU source incorporated here is the GPLv2 version made available in Horizon-OC / Benchmark Toolbox.

## 4. deko3d

The Wizard's GPU test is project-original code written against the public **deko3d** API. deko3d itself is linked as a library.

## Distribution note

When distributing an `.nro` built from this branch, the corresponding source code must remain available under GPL-2.0-only. Publishing the NRO from the same public GitHub repository as its complete buildable source is the intended distribution method for this project.

The in-app test screen also identifies the active upstream test engine and displays the GPL/no-warranty notice.
